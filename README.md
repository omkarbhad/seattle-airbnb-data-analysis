# Project Motivation 
- For this project I had to choose a Dataset and then pose questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
- Follows the **CRISP-DM** Process while analyzing their data.

# Data Selection
I used the AirBnB's Data which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)

# Preprocessing data:
Data Various Data Preprocessing Techniques are used to Clean the Data.
- Removal of NAs 
- Handling the Categorical data with Dummy Varibles
- Normalising the Data with MinMaxScaler

# Modeling 
I used **Linear Regression** for getting the Important Features from the Listings Dataset, beacause it is one of the most simple and powerful Regression Algorithm.

# Visualization
For this part, I used Seaborn and Matplotlib which are most popular visualisation libraries available.

# Business Questions 
The following Questions were answered in the Blog:
- In which Season of the Year, the occupancy is more ?
- How much the Prices change per month ?
- What are the top favorite Neighborhoods in Seattle ?
- What are the key Factors that influence the Price of an AirBnB ?
- How the AirBnBs are distributed in the city ?
